# desuchan.net: feature parity

Written by `node tools/parity.mjs --write` from the feature rows in `tools/parity-catalog.mjs` and the live scan in `docs/PARITY/live.json`. Fix a wrong row in the catalogue, not here. Its obituary may say "beaten" only when this page has no missing, partial or unreviewed rows and the tower gate has 9 of 9 with evidence.

- Original: desuchan.net (https://desuchan.net/)
- Verse: /boards/ (image boards: desuchan.net, tower gate 1 of 16)
- Live scan: 2026-10-28, HTTP no answer
- History: [docs/HISTORY/desuchan.net.md](../HISTORY/desuchan.net.md)

**Match: 78%**: 7 have, 0 partial, 0 missing, 2 unreviewed, of 9 features.
